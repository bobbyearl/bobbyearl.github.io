<h3>The Bridal Party</h3>

<h4>Maid Of Honor</h4>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/megan.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Megan Carr</strong><br />Megan is one of my three sisters.  We are the two in the middle and also the closest in age.  She was my best friend for much of my childhood. There is absolutely no one else 
I  could think of to be my maid of honor. I am so lucky to have had a sister like her growing up.</p>

<h4>Best Man</h4>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/dillon.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Dillon Earl</strong><br />My one and only brother.  Separated by almost 9 years, Dillon was "what I'd been wishing for."  Boy was that a mistake.  I kid I kid.  I can't imagine my life without such a wonderful brother.  He 
truly is a unique person and I'm honored to have him as my best man.</p>

<h4>Bridesmaids</h4>	
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/allison.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Allison Carr</strong><br />Allie is another one of my sisters.  As the youngest of four, I know she put up with more than her share of sibling abuse. Somehow thfough all of that she still remained a great sister, who 
I know I could count on to do anything for me.  She is such a wonderful person and I am glad I get to share this memory with her.</p>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/jennie.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Jennie Hood</strong><br />Jennie was my 
roommate in college for three years.  We remained close when I came back to 
Charleston after graduation.  Jennie has been there with me through so much.  She is one of my best friends, and this special day would not be complete without her by my side.</p>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/lauren.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Lauren Jackson</strong><br />Lauren has always been more of a sister than a cousin. We had so many summers growing up at our grandma's house that there is no way we would not have become close.  She has to be one of the nicest people I know.  I am so excited that she is back in Charleston and we are able to spend more time together again.</p>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/abby.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Abby Kaniaris</strong><br />Abby and 
I became roommates while we both worked for Daniel Island.  When I can get her to stop studying for a few minutes to come out, we have such a great time.  Even though we have only known each other for a short time I know I am lucky to have found such an amazing friend.</p>

<h4>Groomsmen</h4>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/chip.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Chip Alexander</strong><br />Chip and I were pledge brothers at the same fraternity in college.  Although we were friendly towards one another when we first met, it would take 5 years of living together to become just good friends.  Chip has been by my side all throughout college and into our "adult" life.  We both share a passion for quoting movies.  Do Work Son.</p>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/griffin.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Griffin Biering</strong><br />Griffin is another fraternity brother from college.  We lived together with Chip when I moved down to Charleston.  Griffin provides non-stop laughs even when he's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnxSfhv42tw" target="_blank">dancing to techno music</a>.</p>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/clay.jpg" alt="" /><strong>Clay Hadden</strong><br />Clay was another roommate from college.  I have Clay alone to thank for pushing me to apply to be an Orientation Assistant in college.  It was such an amazing experience that changed my life, and without him I would never had done it.  On a side note, Clay hates <a href="http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/BDX/BDX382/bxp126918.jpg" target="_blank">cotton balls</a>.</p>
<p class="caption clearfix"><img src="img/john.jpg" alt="" /><strong>John Ramsey</strong><br />John and I have been through everything together.  To this day, there's a picture of us on his parent's refrigerator door where we're laying in the bed reading Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  That picture's from a 
few months ago.  Or kindergarten, I can't remember.</p>
