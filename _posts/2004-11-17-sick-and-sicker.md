Sick and Sicker as opposed to Dumb and Dumber, crafty I know. So I went from feeling literally sick to feeling like someone took a mack truck and ran me over. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s just a cold or if it&#8217;s the flu or if I&#8217;m dying or what. Well I actually I know we&#8217;re all dying. It just feels like I&#8217;m dying faster than anyone else right now. It couldn&#8217;t have come at a worse time either. I had a huge meeting with my writing 465 teacher to discuss my project. I had to basically ask for an extension to get it done. I&#8217;ve already had two tests this week. One computer architecture and the other modern physics. Not exactly easy stuff. On top of that I have some database work I need to get done for Springs as well as fix a few things involved with Orientation.

The only real comfort I have (calling it comfort sounds evil but oh well) is that both Chip and Ashley are sick. Same symptoms as I so I have no doubt that we have the same thing. I&#8217;m sure the weather has a lot to do with it. Hot &#8230; Cold &#8230; Hot &#8230; VERY Cold &#8230; Hot. That kind of weather messes with your system. On top of that the college lifestyle is just asking to get sick. I&#8217;m like working the corner of virus lane or something. Constantly spreading yourself thin is not a good habit but almost a necessity if you want to do well. At least I have people to be sick with me. 

We have our KS retreat this weekend. I&#8217;m debating on whether I&#8217;ll even be able to go. I have so much to do. Even more considering I have to play catch up for the first part of the week. I would really like to go simply because I&#8217;m ready for a break. The other exciting thing is that Thanksgiving Break is merely a week away. Once again, a much deserved &#8220;rest&#8221; from academics.
