  I need to write. I know I need to write about something. Suddenly when I sit down to write I can&#8217;t think of anything. Important events<br /> are supposed to inspire you to write. Perhaps I&#8217;ll just start by what&#8217;s happened to me since my last thought. *Looking back at my last thought* I really don&#8217;t like putting &#8220;actions&#8221;<br /> in my thoughts but it looked cool so what the hell.

  I last wrote on the 16th of September. Well it&#8217;s October which means the month has changed. I had several tests and projects in that time. I did well on my tests. Got a B on my first<br /> modern physics test. Got an A in software engineering and a B in programming languages. I made a C on a writing 465 class. The same class that I forgot to SU. Not very smart on<br /> my part but oh well. I&#8217;m sure lots more happened since then but oh well. I guess it wasn&#8217;t that important if I can&#8217;t remember it.

  What do I have coming up? Well our first lacrosse game is this weekend. It&#8217;s a scrimage against Presbyterian College. They&#8217;re a new team so it should be a pretty good game. I&#8217;m<br /> excited to have that adrenaline rush back again. It&#8217;s also a great stress reliever for me getting to run and hit people. We also have our alumni weekend for Kappa Sigma which I&#8217;m also<br /> looking forward to.

  I&#8217;m tired so I&#8217;m going to bed. This is probably a crappy entry, as opposed to all the other ones which are pure excitement.
