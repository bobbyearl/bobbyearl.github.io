I started. I wrote. I read. I deleted. 

For some reason I can&#8217;t seem to bring myself to always write what I&#8217;m feeling. I am working on it I promise. Just like the webcam. I&#8217;m working on that one too. As a start I have decided to write about some things I would like to accomplish in my life before I die. This list is in no order, only other that I think about it. I might as well go ahead and tell you that I&#8217;m not expecting myself to think of everything at once. There is a strong possiblity that I will be going back and adding things. Luckily thanks to those that commented I know people read it. Actually I knew people read it because I track my statistics but that&#8217;s boring to most. As I started typing this I got Deja Vu. That was exciting. If you feel the need to write a list well then go right ahead.
