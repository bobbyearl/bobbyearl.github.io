CSS is amazing. In approximately 1 hour I completely changed the look and feel of my site. It really only took that long because I had to tweak a few things, some one-time fixes kind of stuff. By simply changing one file I have completely redesigned my site. It&#8217;s just amazing. 

Let me just give you a run down of the events happening lately. I can&#8217;t drive my truck because the tags are expired. I can&#8217;t afford to buy new tags because I&#8217;m too poor. My bicycle was stolen. If I find the bastard(s) that did it I am scared of what I will do. Lots of physical pain and suffering I&#8217;m sure. That pretty much leaves me bumming rides from people and walking. My pet mouse died. I&#8217;m also sick with a cold. 

That&#8217;s a lot of crap on my shoulders, literally. Surprisingly though I&#8217;m not in a bad mood. I feel literally sick but I don&#8217;t have that weighed down feeling that I get a lot. Maybe that comes with age or maybe drugs. Nyquil is one hell of a drug. It knocks you out within 20 minutes. 

I&#8217;m tired of typing. I feel as if I&#8217;m in the mood where I might type something and then regret it later. I don&#8217;t wanna do that because then I&#8217;d have to deal with. I&#8217;m out.
