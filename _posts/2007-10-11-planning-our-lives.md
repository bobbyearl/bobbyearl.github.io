There&#8217;s no doubt Ashley and I have thought about our respective futures. Ever since childhood most people think about &#8220;what they want to be when they grow up.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure about her or other people, but I never really thought about my significant other in those dreams. Honestly, I had lots of thoughts about what I wanted to become when I grew up. And please excuse the cliche ones:

  * Police Officer
  * Comedian
  * Computer Programmer
  * Actor
  * Politician<!--more-->

That&#8217;s really just to list a few. In any case they never included my wife. It wasn&#8217;t like I purposefully excluded her, just never really thought of her. I think that&#8217;s why this is such a new experience. One that Ashley and I finally had a chance to talk about. What do we want to do with our lives.

It was pretty obvious at some point we both wanted kids. After finally talking about what we both wanted to get out of life, we came to the conclusion we&#8217;d both like to live outside of SC for some part of our life. I&#8217;m sure this might change about ten times between now and then, but the last idea we came up with was to move DC. It&#8217;s a much larger city than Charleston, Rock Hill and especially Hickory Grove.

In any case, it&#8217;s actually pretty exciting to think about the rest of your life with the person you love.
