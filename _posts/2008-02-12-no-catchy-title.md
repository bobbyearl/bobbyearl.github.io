Well it appears I lack a desire to write any kind of blog entry.  I&#8217;ve done an amazing job of updating my twitter status which shows up above.  I&#8217;m not promising to write more.  I&#8217;m not sure it necessary now.  I&#8217;ll hold onto this format for a little longer.

I might as well attempt to update you on a few things.  Our photographer posted our wedding photos so I encourage you to check those out.  Definitely some keepers.

Ashley and I have also decided to move out.  It&#8217;s going to be hard because we both enjoy our roommate&#8217;s company, but we&#8217;re excited to have a place with just the two of us &#8211; and a dog or cat.  <img src="http://life.bobbyearl.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  We&#8217;re mainly looking at staying downtown or moving back to Daniel Island.  Keep our eyes open for anything interesting though.  Our lease doesn&#8217;t end until the end of June so we have several more months to find something.
