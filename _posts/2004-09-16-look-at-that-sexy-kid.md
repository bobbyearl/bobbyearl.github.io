(!Kidding Just) Holy Crap. It&#8217;s hard being a good student. I&#8217;m not going to lie, I couldn&#8217;t tell you a time prior to this semester that I&#8217;ve cared about my grades. It&#8217;s actually funny because I preached for over two years to incoming freshman how they were going to have to change their study habits from high school. I however never followed my own advice. I&#8217;ve studied here and there. I&#8217;ve read over my notes or spent a little time on a project. I&#8217;ve never really changed the amount of studying and time on school work in probably about ten years. For some reason I believe it finally started to dawn on me. I want to do well in school. I&#8217;m paying, well borrowing, a crap load of money to be here. If I don&#8217;t do well I&#8217;m not getting my moneys worth. 

I&#8217;m taking two 400-level computer science classes, an intensive writing class (arguably one of the most challenging classes here at Winthrop), and a modern physics class. To some that might not sound so bad but to someone that&#8217;s trying to do better in school that&#8217;s a bitch. The past three years I&#8217;ve been here I was so involved on-campus. This semester has definitely changed that. I don&#8217;t even have time to do work for my job here. Luckily they&#8217;re understanding that academics come first. I&#8217;ve had to miss several lacrosse practices. I&#8217;m just going to have to realize I can&#8217;t do everything now that I&#8217;m focusing my attention where is should be, on my  
academic career.
