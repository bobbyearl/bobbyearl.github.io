Man I am tired. Oh God, look at me now. I&#8217;ve started this blog by complaining. I can&#8217;t do that. I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;ve have a bad summer. This past month has just flown by. Work has been quite the learning experience as far as becoming more familiar with a few programming languages and allowing me to tune my skills some. There were several times I started to write to tell you about all the good things that were happening and of course I can&#8217;t remember them now but I&#8217;m sure they were good. 

A little pity now. I&#8217;m taking 18 hours (that&#8217;s six classes) this semester. That last 18 hours I&#8217;ll ever take unless I take graduate classes but I seriously doubt that will happen. They claim you should study/prepare 2 hours for every 1 hour you&#8217;re in class &#8211; so that&#8217;s 36 hours. Then there&#8217;s my 20+ hours for work. Top that off with my involvement in Kappa Sigma, Lacrosse and whatnot. That&#8217;s a mimimum of 74 hours a week I&#8217;m dedicated to something. I&#8217;m sure things will ease up a little as I get back into the swing of things but man these first few weeks are gonna be rough. 

To end on a happy note Friday is my birthday. I will be 22. Whooptie-doo. I am going down to Charleston to relax and have a great time. I really need it seeing as how I didn&#8217;t even get a good vacation this summer. The virginia trip was fun but I needed more. Hopefully this stint will hold me off until spring break. Anyway, wish me luck.
