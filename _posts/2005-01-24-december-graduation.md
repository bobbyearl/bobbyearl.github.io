I know December is a long time away. More specifically December 16, which is nearly ten months and twenty-two days away. Despite the fact, I can&#8217;t help but already start and wonder what I&#8217;m gonna do after I walk across that stage. I really have no clue what I want to do. There are three major options I have. 

  * **Graduate School**
Originally never an option. There more I think about it though it seems possible. I&#8217;ve been in school this long, why stop now? If I am to try graduate school I have to get some things into gear very soon. I need to take the GRE and do well on it. I also need try with 100% of my effort in raising my GPA. That including dropping all thing extracurricular, possibly even taking some easy summer classes just to raise it.

  * **Military**
I have thought about the military for some time now. Even since I was younger. I&#8217;m not sure of which branch I would even join. Just want to be able to say, I joined the armed forces, I served my country. This option would require an obvious change in my eating and exercise habits in order to get into shape. Lots of times they&#8217;ll pay for more education and pay off your old loans.

  * **Get a job**
The most practical and easiest choice I have. I started looking around for jobs and found lots of well paying jobs that I was qualified for. Obviously it would deal with computers

To some this wouldn&#8217;t be such a hard choice. What makes this decision harder for me is I have no objection to moving. Matter-of-fact I think I&#8217;d like to get away for a while. I like this area, I like this state, but I want to live outside of SC for part of my life. My [thoughts][1] can be seen here. Whatever decision I make, I know it well be thought out and that I&#8217;ll have fun.
