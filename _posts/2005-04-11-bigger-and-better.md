I want to write about my desk. It&#8217;s so friggity diggity awesome. A little used but definitely an improve with my last desk. It is still a nice desk because Tony&#8217;s taking it which is an improvement from his current desk. Look at that nice picture of my new desk. I just don&#8217;t think I can write an entire entry about my new desk. It would be boring and no one would like it. So&#8230;

I&#8217;ll write about other stuff too. Right now, this very second, I&#8217;m exhausted. It was the final week for our pledges which means every single night is a late one. Then on Friday I pretty much got wasted. Ole Waffles had a good time too which I haven&#8217;t seen in a while since he&#8217;s a big bad teacher now. That was a nice change. I think all of my roomates had a good time that night. Then Saturday night was Buffett Bash which I had fun at. It was evident that everyone was as tired as I was. It felt really good to see people this weekend that I haven&#8217;t gotten the chance to see or hang out with in a long time because I&#8217;ve been so busy. Then today I went and saw a couple of my brother&#8217;s baseball games which merited about 2 hours of driving there, then to HG (to get my new BIG desk), then back to the thrill.
