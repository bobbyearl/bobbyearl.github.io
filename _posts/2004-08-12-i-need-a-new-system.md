It&#8217;s been sometime since I&#8217;ve posted. I have actually had the urge to post on several occasions but didn&#8217;t. The system, which I plan to use to post in still in production stages. I plan to create my own blogging software basically. Of course all the other projects I&#8217;ve been working on have kept me busy. One that I&#8217;m quite proud of is the pobox.winthrop.edu update. You&#8217;ll need a Winthrop email account to actually view it, but let me just tell you it was a bitch to figure out. The code for that is horrible. No real type of organization. Enough of my csci junk. 

Orientation job is starting to wrap up. We have a little bit of work left to do but then it&#8217;s over. I&#8217;m looking forward to it to be honest so I can spend more time doing programming work. It was an experience to say the least working for that office. I have gained a lot of very valuable experience in dealing with different parents, students, and departments. 

My academic career was cleared up a little today. I met with a professor and finally figured out when I was going to be able to graduate. I had no idea due to my crappy advisor, well ex-advisor now. I could graduate as early as December of &#8217;05 or take my time and graduate that spring of &#8217;05. I&#8217;ll probably end up doing the latter (that reference goes out to my latter buddies) if I can get the financial aid to stay that long. If not, I really have no idea what I might do. Rob a bank perhaps, j/k. I&#8217;m sure everything will work out. Everything will always work out.
