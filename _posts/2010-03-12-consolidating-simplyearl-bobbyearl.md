In early 2007, when Ashley and I decided to get married, I created simplyearl.com.  The idea was to continue to my personal blogging and social network tracking as I&#8217;d previously done on bobbyearl.com, but to add Ashley as a contributor.  In the 3 year span simplyearl was running, she hasn&#8217;t contributed once.  I can see her now giving me that poop eating grin.  At this point I would probably have better luck having Reeves contribute to the blog than Ashley.

<div id="attachment_192" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a rel="lightbox" href="{{ '/assets/img/blog/wp-content/' | append: site.baseurl }}uploads/2010/03/7023_131166834823_629384823_2323704_1731796_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-192" title="ReevesKeyboard" src="{{ '/assets/img/blog/wp-content/' | append: site.baseurl }}uploads/2010/03/7023_131166834823_629384823_2323704_1731796_n-225x300.jpg" alt="Reeves using the keyboard" width="225" height="300" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Reeves Using The Keyboard
  </p>
</div>

That being the case I have decided to combine both sites and my brand if you will back into bobbyearl.com.  I&#8217;m also hoping that this also inspires me to write more.  I&#8217;m still working on exactly how I want to combine them and which section to place emphasis.  So for now, simplyearl will redirect all traffic to bobbyearl.  I also am not interested in moving my custom WordPress theme so please pardon the free theme.
