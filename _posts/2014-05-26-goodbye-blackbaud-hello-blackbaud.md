title: Goodbye Blackbaud, Hello Blackbaud
---

On May 1, I celebrated my one year anniversary at Blackbaud.  I imagine this comes with age, but the year has flown by.  I've really come to enjoy what I do at work.  Despite thoroughly enjoying the work and challenges, I fairly quickly saw many opportunities within the company where I might be able to give back more.

It's with great pride and excitement that I announce I'll be taking a new role as Senior Software Engineer with the documentation team.  There are lots of details to work out.  This new position will allow me to directly interact with our product teams and the external developer community (think GitHub) to showcase the potential for extensibility in our products.

This will be an amazing opportunity for me.  I won't start until around July 1, but I anticipate this new opportunity will allow many new topics to post about.  Happy Memorial Day - Many thanks to the men and women that have made it possible.
