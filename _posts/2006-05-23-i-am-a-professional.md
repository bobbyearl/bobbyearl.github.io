Work&#8217;s going great. I just got back from Artesia, NM where I installed software at the US Border Patrol Academy. I have [some pictures from the trip][1]. The folks at work made a special picture using my nickname at work &#8211; Bearl. I also posted a few pictures from the [Charleston Beer Festival][2] which includes a random photo of me and Stephen Cooley. 

I&#8217;ll be moving again soon. Hopefully closer to the beach. I&#8217;m looking forward to it because of the obvious reason of being so close to the beach, but also having roomates again. Some people are glad when they finally get rid of their roomates but I&#8217;ve found that I enjoy the company. 

Chip and I have mimmicked the 5 D&#8217;s of Dodgeball &#8211; Dodge, Dip, Duck, Dive, and &#8230; Dodge &#8211; with our own 5 B&#8217;s. Bitches, Beaches, Beer, Bocci, and &#8230; Bitches. Other than work and goofing off there&#8217;s not much more I can say.
