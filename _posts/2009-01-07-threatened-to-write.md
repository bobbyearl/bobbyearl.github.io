I&#8217;m not even sure I feel like writing posts anymore. I frequently update my status via <a href="http://simplyearl.com/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Bobby-Earl/45500018" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. I really don&#8217;t have a good reason why I don&#8217;t write posts anymore. It&#8217;s certainly not for a lack of interesting things going on in my life.  I think the best reason I can come up with is the time it takes to sit down and write a post, versus one-liners.

Ashley and I decided to make the plunge and become home-owners.  It was a rather hectic time, and we just couldn&#8217;t seem to get the many aspects of our lives to line up.  We were living in a 3rd floor loft when we found out she was pregnant.  As per the landlord’s suggestion, we decided to break the lease without penalty and look for somewhere else to live.  It seemed a good a time as any to <a title="Jennie Hood Real Estate" href="http://jenniehood.com" target="_blank">buy a home</a>.  After looking and finally finding what we felt was the perfect house, the negotiations on price fell through.  After already having committed to being out of the loft by a certain time, we were forced to move into an apartment.

We decided to build in the same <a title="Carolina Bay Charleston" href="http://carolinabaycharleston.com" target="_blank">neighborhood</a> as our perfect house.  It worked out much better.  We&#8217;re getting more house with exactly what we want it, for less money.  In the interim we moved into a one bedroom apartment on Daniel Island.  There was a little mix-up with the elevator not working for our move-in, but other than that the apartment hasn&#8217;t been bad.  I&#8217;m just anxious to have a real house to take care of, so I find every little problem with the place now.  Our only real problem is not enough space.  Ashley, Reeves, Tucker and I are quickly running out of room.  Our closing date is in the middle of March, which is another story in itself.  That day cannot get here soon enough.

I&#8217;m back at <a title="VarnerMiller" href="http://varnermiller.com" target="_blank">VarnerMiller</a> as their Systems Engineer.  I do miss the folks over at the college of knowledge, but I enjoy my work now many times over.  It&#8217;s more challenging and I have the ability to be more creative.  I couldn&#8217;t ask for more in a job.

Ashley&#8217;s due date is January 29.  Technically the date is February 11, but we like the original date they gave us better.  Also I&#8217;m not a fan of the month of February for two reasons.  First, it&#8217;s spelled weird.  FebRuary is just weird.  Second, the number of days in the month of FebRuary changes, which is simply annoying.  Last I knew, we&#8217;ve decided on Reeves Alan Earl as a name.  Most people either love it or hate it, which I&#8217;m okay with.  We&#8217;re ecstatic to have our first child.  I know it&#8217;s going to be rough, no doubt about that, but I&#8217;m still very humbled by the entire experience.  Just yesterday, I commented about how strange it was that I am no longer creeped-out at the OB/GYN.  It&#8217;s so obvious to see the guys in there for the first time.

I&#8217;ve commented on most of the major things in my life, that I can remember.  To be honest, I was pressured to write from Ashley.  While I won&#8217;t discuss specifics, I did not take her threats lightly.  :-)
