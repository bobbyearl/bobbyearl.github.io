**3:00 PM**

I decide I&#8217;m going to do it. Free Chick-Fil-A for a year. That&#8217;s 52 coupons for free value meals. I tell Lori where I&#8217;m going and head from Mount Pleasant to James Island. It seems every cop in the world is on the same road I am forcing me to not speed. I even almost kill a bicyclist as he  
veers onto the connector trying to fix his CD player.

**3:20 PM**

I make three friggin&#8217; trips around the block trying to decide whether there&#8217;s already 100 people in line. Finally, after 10 minutes of driving I decide I&#8217;ll be mad at myself for a long time if I at least don&#8217;t get out and see what number they&#8217;re up to.

**3:30 PM**

I just missed a sign-in and now they&#8217;re doing roll call so I have to wait 20 minutes. I find out I&#8217;m number 106 &#8211; just 6 people shy of being guaranteed a spot in the top 100. I decide to go ahead and sign up hoping that at least 6 people ahead of me will drop out.

**4:00 PM**

My nuts are on fire. I&#8217;m in blue jeans and a collared shirt. Finally I get some reinforcements and a change of clothes. Ashley signs up as number 122 and Chip doesn&#8217;t wanna hobble across Folly Rd. to get his driver&#8217;s license so he decides to hang out. I&#8217;m told they&#8217;re gonna have roll calls every hour. Anyone over the top 100 get entered into a raffle for 5 of the prizes. The longer you&#8217;re there the more tickets you have the raffle.

**8 friggin&#8217; 30 PM**

Over 4 hours before another roll call. I&#8217;m pretty pissed but a free chicken  
sandwich heals all the pain. That plus the pizza we ordered. Time&#8217;s gone by pretty fast at this point. Having Chip and Ashley there make it a hell of a lot better considering there are definitely some strange folks at this thing. Luckily I&#8217;m not one of those.  :-)
