&#8220;Work Work Work Work, Hello Boys, miss me?&#8221; Five dollars to anyone who can name that movie. Anyway, I&#8217;ve devoted so much of my time to my work lately. It&#8217;s not bad because I thoroughly enjoy what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m currently preparing a template for our new student email message server which will blend into the university&#8217;s overall theme for websites. I&#8217;m gaining even more valuable experience through it all. I have no question that my hard work will pay off.

It&#8217;s become my belief that college students end up doing one or a combination of three things during the summer.

  1. Take classes
  2. Be incredibly lazy
  3. Work insane amounts usually due to the fact that you&#8217;re the low man on the totem pole

As said I have been doing lots of work, the low man fortunately isn&#8217;t applicable to me. Sitting down writing this entry have I remembered all the work I&#8217;ve done so far. Started off by creating a website displaying time and date, current weather conditions based on an xml feed from weather.com, and a snapshot of a campus webcam. I then began tweaking our shared network drives to be accessible from off-campus. That one&#8217;s not quite finished. Turns out setting up new accounts wasn&#8217;t so much of a problem but changing our 8,000 some accounts is difficult. I created a few FireFox &#8220;Search Engines&#8221; to search the Winthrop web, faculty/staff, and students.
