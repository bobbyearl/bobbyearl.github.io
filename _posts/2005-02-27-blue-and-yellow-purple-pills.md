High Blood Pressure. I&#8217;ve had it for some time now. It&#8217;s always teetering on the brink of requiring attention and just being a little too high. A few weeks ago I started getting bad headaches. Sure, just headaches. Take some Tylenol and you&#8217;ll be fine. My case is a little unique. I NEVER get headaches. I could probably count the number of headaches I&#8217;ve ever gotten on my two hands (that means no more than ten). After about the fourth day of my headaches I decided I needed to do something. I went to one of those crazy little machines that takes your blood pressure at Eckerds (I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s now how you spell it but that&#8217;s how I say it). 159 over 97. Poopie. Way to high. 

One <acronym title="Electrocardiogram">EKG</acronym>, one blood sample, one urine sample, and two x-rays later she says I have the string things around my heart. I have to change my diet. No more than 3 grams of salt per day and no alcohol. Plus, gotta take this tiny pill every day. One small problem there, I can&#8217;t swallow pills. &#8220;Well if you want to get better then you&#8217;ll learn&#8221; Amazingly I learned how to swallow pills.
