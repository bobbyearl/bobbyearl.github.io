I looked back at my entries, even back to my old school journals. Every time I wrote I was sad or mad. I never seemed to write when I was happy. Now one could think, maybe you&#8217;re never happy. That is possible but I do seem to remember a day when not everything was gloomy. I&#8217;m asking for help then. If you&#8217;re reading this then you probably talk to me on a somewhat regular basis. If I seem happy you should say, &#8220;Bobby you should write an entry about you being happy.&#8221; Sounds like a plan to me. 

Since there isn&#8217;t much content here I&#8217;m gonna put up this photo of the &#8220;How our state fares on the SAT.&#8221;. I do believe it&#8217;ll keep you entertained for hours. I would like to point out that the part of York County that I&#8217;m from is very above average.
