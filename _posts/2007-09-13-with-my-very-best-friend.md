[Clay][1] and Rob came to visit. They provided lots of fun and even brought a few cd&#8217;s. Perhaps my favorite song is a cover of *Rockin&#8217; Chair* by Death Cab for Cutie. There were a few other good ones from Nada Surf, Fall Out Boy, and Modest Mouse.

Only 2 months and 4 days left until the big day. Everyone keeps asking if I&#8217;m nervous, which I slightly am, but not for the reasons most people are nervous before their wedding. I&#8217;m actually a little nervous about making sure things go right. I usually get nervous about making sure things go to plan. I just want to be sure Ashley has the best day. There&#8217;s absolutely no anxiety about getting married. I get to spend the rest of my life with my very best friend.

I also updated some of the [wedding stuff][2] in the past few days. Ashley, Chip and I also created a facebook application called [Birthday Card][3], which allows you to post birthday cards on a friends wall, instead of just a boring message. In the three days it&#8217;s been live, we have 941 active users. We&#8217;ve also raised a total of 58 cents. Yay.
