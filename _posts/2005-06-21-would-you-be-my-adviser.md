I&#8217;ve chosen a profession. I am going to be an evil villan. I have decided that I do indeed have a nemisis. I&#8217;m sure my friends that know me are thinking, &#8220;don&#8217;t you already have about 40 of those?&#8221; Well indeed but this time it&#8217;s a professional rival, okay another professional rival because I know I already have one of those too. I don&#8217;t want you to think I have nothing but enemies, I just have a hard time with the &#8220;forgive and forget&#8221; slogan. More-so just the forget part.

I don&#8217;t want to get too specific about who this person is and why they&#8217;re my nemesis in an effort to not bore you. This person is the &#8220;master,&#8221; let&#8217;s say, of something that I am passionate for. I know I&#8217;m not the best at what I do and I doubt I&#8217;ll ever be. I do not, however, doubt that I am good at what I do. I am always learning yet I&#8217;ve learned so much already. It just amazes me when I see people in positions that my turds have more qualifications for. Especially when ultimately I as a student and taxpayer am paying for their job. This person&#8217;s roll has such a huge impact on the public&#8217;s perception of the overall institution. This person&#8217;s work is continually shitty. It&#8217;s ridiculous that I as a student have to come in and fix things which are supposed to fall under the realm of this employee which makes thousands of dollars. I just hope one day I will be able to find a job which matches the skills that I am so passionate about. I can promise that I will always do a better job than this person either.
