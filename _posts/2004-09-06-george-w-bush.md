  And I was doing so well. Once again I&#8217;ve had the urge, need even, to write but failed to do so because of my current method. I<br /> know I&#8217;m not going to have a lot of time now to work on it either. Oh well. School&#8217;s started. It&#8217;s going well so far, definitely keeping me busy. I think that&#8217;s when I work best though, when I&#8217;m busy. Lots going on right now outside of academia. Lacrosse conditioning, Kappa Sigma rush, working for Winthrop. I found this text online so I thought I&#8217;d post it on here. Remember, to my knowledge this material is copyright the owner. I am not the owner.
