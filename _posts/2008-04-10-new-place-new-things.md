Ashley and I finally found a new place to move.  We&#8217;ll be living on the third floor of and 1890&#8217;s Queen Anne style house.  It kind of have a lofty feeling, which I was looking for, but is large enough for the two of us with 1100 square feet.  The living room and kitchen are one room with a large bench seat window.  The bedroom is huge and has three skylights.  To the right is the walk-in closet with full-size brand new front load washer and dryer, also with a large window.  To the left is the bathroom with double sinks, a stand-up shower and a large claw foot tub, also with a large window.

To say we&#8217;re excited about it is an understatement.  When we went and looked at it I was almost giddy.  The homeowner lives on the first floor and seems like a cool guy.  We move in May 1st.  Not looking forward to the actual move again.  Just have to keep my eye on the prize and I think it will be ok.

It&#8217;s also going to be a different experience finally being able to live with just Ashley.  I&#8217;m going to miss my roommates.  I&#8217;ve had roommates since the day I started college.  In fact I&#8217;ve lived with Chip for about 5 years now and Clay 4.  I think it&#8217;s finally time to bite the bullet and live with just my wife though.  :-)

On to new things&#8230;

Ashley and I played our first kickball game last night.  In typical fashion I got really excited and then I don&#8217;t really feel like doing it at the very last minute.  I pushed through anyway, thank goodness.  We lead the entire game but they caught up during the last inning.  Tough loss but I still had a great time.  Our team seems to get along well so I don&#8217;t expect any problems there.

I&#8217;m planning on documenting the move and will get some pictures up of our new place once we get settled.  Just as an FYI, if you&#8217;re ever feeling just a little too peppy try listening Elliot Smith.  His music will definitely bring you down a peg or two.  Matter-of-fact, his music made him so miserable he took his own life, which is sad because I like his stuff.
