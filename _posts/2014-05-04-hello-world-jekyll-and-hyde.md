title: Hello world, Jekyll and Hyde
---

For reasons I can't exactly explain, I've felt the need to write again.  Perhaps it's a renewed interest in the developer community.  Regardless the reason, I haven't consistently blogged in over 10 years.  Typically I'd focused on personal ramblings, but honeslty I feel the need to make this more technical in nature.

### Jekyll

Sticking with the technical theme, I setup several new technologies to write this blog.  Instead of a one-click Wordpress install, I chose to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.  As Jekyll is a static site generator, performance and security are huge benefits, especially when compared to Wordpress.  I'm obviously some capabilities which Wordpress or a comparable CMS provides, but for my infrequent blog site, it seemed perfect.

Setup was mostly painless.  The only point of confusion was whether to use <a href="http://bundler.io" target="_blank">Bundler</a> or not.  The <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages" target="_blank">help article</a> describes using it, whereas the Jekyll page didn't seem very concerned with it.  Most likely my confusion comes from a lack of understanding its capabilities, but currently I am not using it.

### Hyde

Not particularly caring about the aesthetics of this site, <a href="http://andhyde.com" target="_blank">Hyde</a> seemed like the perfect fit.
