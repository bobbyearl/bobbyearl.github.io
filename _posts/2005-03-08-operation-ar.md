This past weekend I went to Myrtle Beach with my family. My dad was at a <acronym title="South Carolina Physical Plant Administrators">SCAPPA</acronym> conference. They gave me a scholarship my freshman year so I feel a little partial to them. I really had nothing to do with the conference. Instead I enjoyed a few days of baseball with Dillon, the pool, and the best: THE JACUZZI (or hot tube).

I will own a hot tub before I die. I will drive, hell walk every where. Whatever it takes but I will own one! Despite a little wind, the weather was nearly perfect. I even got to work on my pasty white legs. Now they&#8217;re move of a dirty t-shirt white as opposed to an Elmer&#8217;s glue white. Ashley also let me borrow her camera so I took some [photos of my trip][1]. Including the one above which is my favorite. It looks like a postcard. 

I only \*cheated\* on my diet once this weekend when I had some white bread. Oh well, I felt a reward was in order. I was on vacation after all. So far, I&#8217;ve lost 9 pounds. I&#8217;m still 20 pounds from my end of semester goal. This week is going to be a little hectic. I have three tests, am trying to get the Orientation Registration system live, and trying to find something cheap and fun to do for Spring Break. 

Before I left for the beach I cleaned and organized my entire room and car. It was like I couldn&#8217;t stop straightening up. Kind of weird. But now at least everything is in it&#8217;s place. It&#8217;s so much more comforting coming home to a clean room. I&#8217;m sure by the end of this week everything will be messy again though.
