Girls want guys with great skills. Like bo hunting skills, computer hacking skills. So I got a job at Carowinds. Excuse me, Paramount&#8217;s Carowinds. I&#8217;m sure some would consider that stooping to a new low, and dependant upon the job as would I. However, I&#8217;m working the Information Services (&#8220;IT&#8221;) department. It&#8217;s really not a bad job. I get good hours which is gonna be a little tough right now but during the summer the hours will be great. The only deterant from the job was the fact that you have to be clean shaven. I just don&#8217;t like that. I look like a &#8220;husky&#8221; sixteen year old going through puberty without any facial hair. 

I got advised on Wednesday. I officially have EIGHTEEN hours left until I graduate. I wish I wasn&#8217;t such a broke college student that I could afford to take a summer class in order to relieve my Fall semester, but oh well. I&#8217;m taking eighteen hours now and am doing well so I should be fine. My [proposed 2005 schedule][1] is still changing at this point. Not sure whether I&#8217;m going to take the intro to Geology class or Oceanography. I can tell you which one I&#8217;d like to take, neither. 

For some reason that reminds me of a joke&#8230; There once was a man from Nantucket. Just kidding about that one. It does remind me of the joke when you&#8217;re riding by a cemetary and say &#8220;People are just dying to get into a place like that,&#8221; or &#8220;Do you know how many dead people are in that place? All of them!&#8221; Good stuff. Larry Earl originals I believe.
