I typed here in all caps just so everyone will understand HOW EXCITED I AM. In case you didn&#8217;t understand, typing in all caps shows just how happy and ecstatic you really are. From now on I suggest that if you are feeling awesome, you should TYPE IN ALL CAPS! 

Seriously though, Fall Break starts for me today at 6:15. At one point in time I had grand visions of going somewhere blah blah, like I do every year. But then I have to come to the realization that I&#8217;m broke and can&#8217;t afford to go anywhere. I&#8217;m sure there will be some other people still in town so I can manage to find some type of enterainment. I do have a good bit of work due when we get back. That&#8217;s not really entertainment though. The main objective of this weekend is to sleep. Lots of sleep. 

I&#8217;m not gonna lie to you here, I&#8217;ve written this entry in two parts. The first part, I had no money. Now, I have money. I went home to find a 100 dollar rebate check from my monitor waiting on me. HAPPY ME. Look all caps. I still think I&#8217;m gonna stay around Rock Hill, except now I&#8217;ll be able to actually eat. Tonight we have a mixer with ADPi. Hopefully enough of them and us haven&#8217;t left for Fall Break yet. 

For those that are habitual readers (that makes it sound like a bad thing), you&#8217;ll probably remember my complaints about how I actually edit/insert new thoughts. Well I&#8217;ve been working on that the past couple days. I&#8217;m now using a Rich Text Editor to update my entries. Pretty exciting huh? Be on the lookout this weekend for some changes. I&#8217;m still focused on actually having a &#8220;comment&#8221; section for my individual entries. 

For everyone that has a Fall Break this weekend, have fun! For everyone else, just hang in there it&#8217;s coming.
