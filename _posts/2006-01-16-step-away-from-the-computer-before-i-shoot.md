I know I know I know &#8211; it&#8217;s been over two months since I&#8217;ve written anything. I really have no reason. I just didn&#8217;t feel like it. I can try my best to give a quick recap. For Thanksgiving Ashley and I went to the Ramsey&#8217;s in good ole Hickory Grove. I think she went home after that but I can&#8217;t remember. I graduated from Winthrop. Christmas came and went. I bought a truck. I accepted a job at Winthrop as an Information Resource Consultant. That&#8217;s pretty much it. 

I like my job at Winthrop. I like the people, the school, the environment, the work. There&#8217;s really nothing bad about it. I am, however, still looking at some other jobs. Tomorrow I have a job interview with the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department for a webmaster position. I had an interview in Charleston as well so there&#8217;s still some other possibilities out there. The biggest thing is I just wanna get out of York County for a while. That&#8217;s pretty much all that&#8217;s happened. 

I did add some [random snapshots][1] of the past couple of months.
