Tomorrow Ashley and I have a 10AM appointment at Gene&#8217;s Bridal. She&#8217;s doing a dress fitting then we&#8217;re looking at possible tuxedos. I&#8217;m standing firm on the tuxedo t-shirt. I feel it best matches the current mullet I have. All I&#8217;ll be missing is a case of Bud diesel &#8211; guess we&#8217;ll save that for the wedding day. [Gotta remember to stop making jokes about the wedding &#8230; and getting married &#8230; and short people]

Although I feel my mullet is no where near the girth and class of Uncle Jesse, I still fill it&#8217;s time for a cut. The thick mop on my head&#8217;s getting too long. I&#8217;m thinking I may mix it up a little and go for a haircut with a &#8220;style&#8221; as opposed to the normal Chip buzzing me on the porch. Perhaps something like Froto above? I&#8217;m quite comfortable with the buzz cut and I&#8217;m not saying there&#8217;s anything wrong with it. I&#8217;ve tried &#8220;styling&#8221; my hair before but to no avail. Bowl cut, dying, bleaching, frosting, I&#8217;ve tried it all but I always come crawling back to the buzz like some sort of beaten step child. Maybe that&#8217;s not the best reference but you get the point.

We&#8217;ve made lots of wedding plans since our last post two months ago. So many plans I can&#8217;t remember them all. Maybe I&#8217;ll make Ashley feel guilty and get here to write again. I&#8217;ve made a few updates to the site including adding our [bridal party][1] and [gift registrations][2]. There are a few things left to do but I just haven&#8217;t been motivated to do them. I think I ran out of steam to make any website changes after launching the \*redesigned\* [College of Charleston alumni website][3].
