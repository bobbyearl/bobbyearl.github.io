Finally, I write. I wanted to before but everytime I&#8217;d start I quit. A lot has changed in my life since I wrote last. I took at job at VarnerMiller in Mount Pleasant, SC. It&#8217;s right outside of Charleston, SC. I like the job. I&#8217;m a systems engineer but my duties range from network administrator to programmer. I am &#8220;the&#8221; it guy. It&#8217;s a much different role than the one I had at Winthrop. This week I worked on fixing some neglected network issues as well as acquanting myself with Flash and it&#8217;s ability to communicate with a database. 

That crap probably doesn&#8217;t excite you like it does me. And not in that sexual excitement way. Well, wait. <img src="http://life.bobbyearl.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> Anyway, my bosses were amazing enough to offer me a place to stay. I&#8217;m living in the townhouse they own which is near they&#8217;re house. I lived with Chip and Ben in West Ashley for a week. I had more fun there just because I was around people but living on the couch wasn&#8217;t too exciting for 3 or 4 months. The drive is 1.1 miles less now but I think it takes about the same amount of time simply because of all the friggin&#8217; people. I used to think there were a lot of people in York County. It&#8217;s just car after car out here. 

I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s gonna be hard in a few months when I move in with Chip and Griffin. The place I&#8217;m in is nice. I mean nicer than anything I&#8217;ve ever lived in before. It&#8217;s hard right now living by myself. I&#8217;ve had a roomate for lived with the parents for twenty-two years and how I&#8217;m all alone. 

About the title: there&#8217;s a lot of construction going on around here. I believe a majority of the construction workers are Mexican. Because of that there&#8217;s a taco truck that comes around. It looks and sounds just like an ice cream truck &#8211; including the kid music playing. I built up the courage to go over for lunch today and get a taco or something but the damn thing drove off before I could get there. I need to be quicker I guess.
