For those that don&#8217;t know I applied for a job in Charleston as a software engineer. Well I found out that they have decided to move further in the application process with other applicants. There are several things which make this really suck. I&#8217;m not that hurt that I didn&#8217;t get that job. I was actually honored to have been there. Half of the applicants had masters degrees. There were really four schools represented: Clemson, UGA, Georgia Tech, and Winthrop. Winthrop isn&#8217;t exactly known for their computer science department so it really speaks that I was invited down there. I did get a free night in a fancy hotel as well as a laptop bag. 

What&#8217;s made this rejection hard is a couple of things. First being I&#8217;ve manifested this job into &#8220;what I need.&#8221; Everything about it seemed to be what I need right now. The facilities were amazing. The pay was great, and most importantly it wasn&#8217;t in York County. It seemed like my ticket out. Not that I am 100% set on leaving this county I just got excited about being in a new area with new things to do. 

The second reason it&#8217;s exceptionally hard for me is that I haven&#8217;t lost in a while. I know that sounds conceited and I&#8217;m not trying to be. I just mean that in some time the things I apply for or decide to go after, I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to get. I look back at all the jobs and positions I&#8217;ve applied for such as: my current job, the Carowinds job, being orientation staff coordinator, being an orientation assistant, working for residence life, getting into Kappa Sigma, getting into Winthrop. All I can focus on right now. Getting turned down &#8211; having someone say that I&#8217;m not good enough has really knocked the wind out of me. I have been very wound up in anticipation for graduation and getting a real job but this has just knocked me down a peg or two.
