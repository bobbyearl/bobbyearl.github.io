That is the flag or Turkey. Hell of a flag, huh? I know you see the symbolism now. One misconception about college: Thanksgiving break does not mean a break from work, just from class. My family is going to the mountains to celebrate Thanksgiving. I have opted to stay here and eat with John&#8217;s family. They always feed me well. I just have too much work that requires the computer. 

This morning I was supposed to have an on-site visit at Springs. I woke up and immediately began to regurgitate. At first I thought it was some bad pizza from Papa Johns but Chip had the same thing so that&#8217;s out. I had some chicken also from Papa Johns and a sald from The Whitehorse. The best I can figure it&#8217;s one of those that my stomach didn&#8217;t like. I didn&#8217;t feel well enough to be able to ride 45 minutes in a car to Lancaster. Instead we&#8217;ve pushed the meeting back to more-than-likely Monday. I felt better by lunch so apparently whatever it was just wanted to get out. 

I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately and damn it sure does hurt. Ahh, I kid. I have been wondering what I&#8217;m gonna do when I graduate. I am nearly 100% sure I don&#8217;t wanna live in Rock Hill. It&#8217;s a nice place but I need to get away for a little while. I can see my epitaph now: 

**Born in York County**  
  
**Learned in York County**  
  
**Lived in York County**  
  
**Died in York County**
